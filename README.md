[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that takes place throughout the month of December.

It was created by Eric Wastl and involves solving a series of small programming puzzles to unlock a story.

Participants can use any programming language they choose to solve the puzzles and compete on a global leaderboard.

The challenge is designed to be accessible to programmers of all skill levels, and many people use it as a way to improve their coding skills and learn new languages. Advent of Code is a fun and engaging way to get into the holiday spirit and sharpen your programming skills at the same time.
